        <p><h2>Classic & Clean: Classic Mexican Salsa</h2></P>

        <P><em>Pico de gallo</em> is a fresh, uncooked Mexican salsa made from a simple mix of chopped tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalapeños or serrano peppers, lime juice, and salt. Unlike blended salsas, <em>Pico de gallo</em> is chunky and vibrant, offering a crisp texture and a refreshing burst of flavor with every bite. Adding brightness and acidity to dishes, making it perfect for tacos, burritos, grilled meats, eggs, nachos, and more. Its flavor is clean and zesty, with just the right amount of heat and tang, making it a go-to condiment in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine. It’s incredibly versatile, and variations can include ingredients like pineapple, mango, cucumber, or corn for a creative twist. Simple, colorful, and always fresh, pico de gallo is a staple that enhances almost any savory dish.</P>
