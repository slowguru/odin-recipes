# odin-recipes

I am creating my first web page, project one on TOP.  I will use what I have learned to build a web page with a few recipes on it. I would like to try to add a few things outside of what I have learned on TOP. I would like to see if I can get a print-the-recipe button or a button to multiply the recipe. At this point, I don't know if this will be done with HTML or CSS, but I will find out.
