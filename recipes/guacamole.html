        <p><h2>Healthy and clean: The perfect smash</h2></P>

        <P>Authentic<em>guacamole</em> is a simple, fresh, and vibrant Mexican dip made primarily from ripe avocados mashed to a creamy yet slightly chunky texture. Traditionally, it combines just a few key ingredients: freshly chopped white onion, bright cilantro leaves, a squeeze of tangy lime juice, and a touch of salt to enhance the natural flavors. Sometimes, a little fresh jalapeño or serrano chili is added for mild heat. The beauty of authentic guacamole lies in its balance—creamy richness from the avocado, freshness from the herbs and lime, and a subtle kick from the chili. </P>

            </ul>

        <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>

            <ul>
                <li>3 ripe Hass avocados</li>
                <li>1 small white onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1–2 serrano or jalapeño peppers, finely chopped (seeds included if you want heat)</li>
                <li>1 medium ripe tomato, seeded and finely chopped</li>
                <li>A handful of fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
                <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
                <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Instructions</h4>

            <ol>
                <lI>Cut avocados in half, remove pits, and scoop the flesh into a bowl.</lI>
                <li>Using a fork or molcajete (traditional mortar and pestle), mash the avocado to a creamy but slightly chunky consistency.</li>
                <li>Mix in onion, chili, tomato, and cilantro.</li>
                <li>Add lime juice and salt to taste. Stir gently to combine. Taste and adjust</li>
            </ol>

                <p><strong>Tips</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Use ripe Hass avocados. They should yield slightly to gentle pressure. Too firm = bland and hard to mash; too soft = mushy or brown inside.</li>
                <li>Add ingredients in stages, start by mashing avocado with lime juice and salt, then fold in onions, chiles, tomato, and cilantro gently to avoid overmixing.</li>
                <li>Don’t skip the lime juice, It enhances flavor and slows oxidation.</li>
                <li>Seed the tomatoes, removing excess water that can make guacamole watery.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>There’s nothing quite like that first bite of freshly made guacamole. The creamy avocado, brightened by a splash of lime juice, meets the subtle heat of chile and the crisp freshness of chopped onion and cilantro. A touch of salt ties it all together, awakening each flavor without overpowering the natural richness of the ingredients.
Scoop it with a warm tortilla chip and you get the perfect contrast—crunchy, cool, vibrant, and satisfying. The tomatoes add gentle sweetness, while the lime offers a clean finish that lingers just long enough to make you reach for more.
Guacamole is best enjoyed immediately, when its texture is lush and its flavors are at their peak. Serve it as a starter, a side, or the centerpiece of a casual gathering. However you present it, this classic dish invites sharing and savoring—one dip at a time.</p>
